canbus_uuid: dda917f9f009

speed: 40
#   Z probing dive speed.
lift_speed: 5
#   Z probing lift speed.
backlash_comp: 0.5 #0.01193
#   Backlash compensation distance for removing Z backlash before measuring
#   the sensor response.
x_offset: 0
#   X offset of idm from the nozzle.
y_offset: 22.8
#   Y offset of idm from the nozzle.
trigger_distance: 2 #1
#   idm trigger distance for homing.
trigger_dive_threshold: 1.5 #1
#   Threshold for range vs dive mode probing. Beyond `trigger_distance +
#   trigger_dive_threshold` a dive will be used.
trigger_hysteresis: 0.006
#   Hysteresis on trigger threshold for untriggering, as a percentage of the
#   trigger threshold.
cal_nozzle_z: 0.1
#   Expected nozzle offset after completing manual Z offset calibration.
cal_floor: 0.1 #0.2
#   Minimum z bound on sensor response measurement.
cal_ceil: 5
#   Maximum z bound on sensor response measurement.
cal_speed: 1
#   Speed while measuring response curve.
cal_move_speed: 10
#   Speed while moving to position for response curve measurement.
default_model_name: default
#   Name of default idm model to load.
mesh_main_direction: x
#   Primary travel direction during mesh measurement.
#mesh_overscan: -1
#   Distance to use for direction changes at mesh line ends. Omit this setting
#   and a default will be calculated from line spacing and available travel.
mesh_cluster_size: 1
#   Radius of mesh grid point clusters.
mesh_runs: 2

#Remember to set [bed_mesh] Otherwise, an error will be reported

#After restarting, move the hot end to the middle and stick the nozzle to the platform with your bare hands. 
#Enter SET_KINEMATIC_POSITION x=[x coordinate of platform center] y=[y axis coordinate of platform center] z=0. 
#Then execute the idm_calibrate command 
#and click on the offset of -0.1 Confirm, calibration will be performed automatically. 
#Enter idm on the console and press the tab key to see all supported commands.

#Lowering the horizontal_z_move in z_tilt or quad_gantry_level below trigger_distance + trigger_dive_threshold (default is 3) can put the leveling into high-speed mode. If it is too low, you can raise the trigger_dive_threshold appropriately so that horizontal_z_move can be raised higher.


#For versions containing an accelerometer (lis2dw), you can add the following content to the configuration to enable the accelerometer:

cs_pin: idm:PA3 
spi_bus: spi1

[resonance_tester] 
accel_chip: lis2dw 
probe_points: 175, 175, 20
